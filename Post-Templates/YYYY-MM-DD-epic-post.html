Dear Artsy Engineer:

What follows is a template for a truly epic blog post. It follows the narrative structure of [the monomyth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces); you are the hero of this myth.

Use this template if you're interested in spending a few hours at least writing the post. You need to copy this file into the `_posts` directory and rename it with the current date and post title. Then go through and write as much as you like for each of the sections described below.

Finally, send a PR and congrats! You've written a blog post.

-->




<!--
Iɴᴛʀᴏᴅᴜᴄᴛɪᴏɴ

An introduction is a 1-2 paragraph overview of what the blog post talks about. It should describe the technologies related to the blog post, but not explain them. Write this last.

Begin your story by establishing the setting (The Ordinary World). You're probably writing a blog post about learning something, so think back to what you and the world were like before you learned that thing. Describe it. What was the world like? What were some of the problems with the world as it existed?

This section only needs to be a few paragraphs long. Don't spend too much time on it – you can come back and revisit it as you write the rest of your story.

Example: Luke is an adolescent farmer with big dreams, but is being held back by his responsibilities to his farm.

The Call to Adventure is the event that precipitated the story you're writing about. Your call to adventure might be a bug report or a feature request. Heroes usually don't accept a call to adventure – at first. They resist but eventually come to realize that they must go on the adventure. Only spend a few paragraphs here.

Example: Obi-Wan Kanobi asks Luke to become a Jedi. Luke turns Obi-Wan down at first, but after his farm is destroyed, he joins the knight to begin his training.

The Ordeal is the biggest part of your post. It can range from five paragraphs to fifty.

Describe, in detail, the ordeal of the adventure. What you learned isn't as important as how you learned it. Make sure to include links to pull requests and issues that you found in your journey. Also include embedded media – like images or youtube videos – to help break up this long section.

Example: Luke travels to faraway lands to help free a political prisoner. He makes friends along the way, but there are costs to his adventure.

This small section is for describing the feeling of accomplishment after you fixed a bug or finished a feature. Take a few paragraphs to reflect on all that you learned.

Example: Luke and his friends are celebrated for their bravery.

The Return is the most difficult section of the story to write. It describes the return of the hero – that's you – to the Ordinary World. But there's a problem: the hero has changed throughout the Ordeal. They aren't the same as they were in the beginning of the story. They've learned and grown. They've come to appreciate the cost of their adventure and reflect on decisions they would have made differently.

Take a few paragraphs to reflect on how you've grown and how the Ordinary World no longer feels like home. For instance, if you've learned a technology, describe how you are frustrated by not being able to apply that technology everywhere.

Example: Years later, Luke is a guardian of the Rebel resistance and helps defend their icy fortress from enemies and snow monsters.
